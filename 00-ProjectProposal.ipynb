    "Technology has been invented in order to make human lives easier, but as this technology keeps evolving, the world starts changing too. With the invention of artificial intelligence (AI), many controversies have come up when it comes to the benefits and disadvantages that it brings to the environment, the economy, education, and our everyday life. Some studies suggest that AI can support environmental sustainability by improving efficiency, energy systems and allow better monitoring of environmental conditions12. At the same time, the fast expansion of AI has created new forms of resource demand that raise sustainability concerns. As AI data centers increase across economic sections, understanding both its potential benefits and environmental consequences has become very important. \n",
    " AI systems rely on very large computer infrastructure that is mainly located in data centers in order to support tasks such as cloud computing, machine learning training, and large data processing. Reviews of data center operations indicate that energy intensive servers and cooling systems make these facilities among the fastest growing sources of industrial electricity consumption worldwide.3 In the United States, the growth of AI has contributed to a fast expansion of data centers infrastructure, increasing overall demand for electricity and placing tension on power systems.4 As AI continues to grow, the physical infrastructure needed to support these technologies has become a main factor in looking at sustainability. \n",
    "Studies demonstrate that data centers contribute to a significant and growing environmental burden in the AI era. Guidi et al, find that U.S. data centers consume a major portion of national electricity and that AI data centers are only increasing this. Large chunks of data centers can put tension on regional power grids, increase peak demand, and sometimes prolong dependency on carbon intensive energy sources.5 In addition to energy consumption, water usage for cooling is a major concern, especially in dry regions. Although solutions like advanced cooling systems, waste heat reuse, and water positive designs have been proposed, their adoption remains inconsistent across facilities.6 Together, these studies show that AI data centers generate major environmental impacts related to electricity demand, greenhouse emissions, and water consumption. \n",
    "In addition to environmental concerns, data centers are often promoted as an economic growth impact in host communities. Research indicates that regulatory environments can increase data center valuation, and attract private investment, encouraging companies to locate large facilities in certain regions.7 Data centers may also contribute to local tax revenue infrastructure development and employment opportunities, particularly in technology and engineering sections.8 However, community research suggests that these economic benefits are often going along with local costs, including increased demand for electricity and water, land use pressure, and environmental stress.9 While prior work studies have examined economic outcomes or environmental impacts separately, only a few directly compare these topics across multiple cities. The lack of research motivates a modified evaluation of whether the economic impacts associated with AI data centers outweigh their environmental costs. \n",

About 10,000 observations (cities in the US) would be a great amount of data. The data would be collected by combining publicly available information from sources like the US Census and the EPA.

Your teams will document these discussions and decisions for posterity using this section.  You don't have to solve these problems, you just have to acknowledge any potential harm no matter how unlikely.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "       Though we are analyzing factors such as environmental impact, the environmental impacts in a certain area could be in worse conditions due to location rather than being simply a result of data center resource usage.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "       By potentially generalizing information to location-specific and not including individual’s data, the exposure of PII would be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "       All the information that we plan to use from datasets would be from publicly available databases, so no confidential and secure data could be potentially compromised.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "       A stakeholder’s perspective that may need to be considered are those of the team behind the data centers (who are subject matter experts), explaining the outcomes and necessary parts that go into powering data centers. This missing perspective may provide crucial insight and context into whatever we analyze from the data to answer our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "    Same as mentioned previously, analyzing factors such as environmental impact, the environmental impacts in a certain area could be in worse conditions due to location rather than being simply a result of data center resource usage (which could be omitted confounding variables). \n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "    This project specifically doesn't involve building or deploying a predictive model; there are ethical concerns related to how our results can be potentially interpreted. Environmental and economic conditions differ immensely from city to city, so certain patterns within the data could be mistaken as simple cause-and-effect relationships when they are actually just correlations. There is also a risk that cities hosting AI data centers could be judged unfairly if differences in infrastructure, climate, or local government policies are not taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To address these concerns previously listed, our team will be very diligent in explaining our limitations of the analysis and avoiding making causal claims without a strong reason to do so. We will present our results with appropriate context and acknowledge uncertainty in the data. By framing our conclusions carefully and avoiding generalizations, we aim to reduce the risk of our findings being misinterpreted."
